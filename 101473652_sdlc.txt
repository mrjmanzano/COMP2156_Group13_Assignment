Importance of learning Devops in the software development cycle
Learning DevOps is important in software development because it 
helps developers and operations teams work together more efficiently.
 In traditional software development, developers build the software, 
 and then operations teams handle its deployment and maintenance. 
 This can lead to delays and communication issues. DevOps changes 
 this by promoting teamwork, where both teams collaborate closely 
 throughout the entire process.
