Learning DevOps in the software development cycle is incredibly important for several reasons. DevOps is a set of practice
that brings together software development (Dev) and IT operations (Ops) to improve collaboration and productivity. DevOps 
enable continuous integration and delivery (CI/CD), leading to quicker realease cycle and faster time-to-market. It encourages 
cross-functional collaboration, reducing friction between development and operations teams. DevOps automates repetitive tasks like
testing and deployment, allowing teams to focus more on high-value work. Early automated ensures higher-quality code and more stable software.
DevOps practices help businesses scale infrastrature quickly and adapt to changing needs. Automation reduces manual work, optimizing resource and lowering costs.
Faster updates and more reliable software improves user experience.
