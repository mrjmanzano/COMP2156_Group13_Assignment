Learning DevOps in the software development cycle is incredibly important for several reasons. DevOps is a set of practice
that brings together software development (Dev) and IT operations (Ops) to improve collaboration and productivity. DevOps 
enable continuous integration and delivery (CI/CD), leading to quicker realease cycle and faster time-to-market. It encourages 
cross-functional collaboration, reducing friction between development and operations teams. DevOps automates repetitive tasks like
testing and deployment, allowing teams to focus more on high-value work. Early automated ensures higher-quality code and more stable software.
